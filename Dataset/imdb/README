# imdb

Scripts to create RDF snapshots from IMDB lists and diffs.

## Prerequisites

`pip intall [--user] rdflib`

## Creating RDF snapshots

To run in the foreground, run:
```
./batch.sh 2>&1 | tee `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M.batch.log`
```

To run in the background, run:
```
nohup ./batch.sh > `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M.batch.log` 2>&1 &
watch -n 30 tail -n 50 <timestamp.batch.log>
```

## IMDB

IMDB snapshots can be recreated backwards from 2017-12-22 to 2014-02-14.
IMDB mirrors are missing the original list file that the diffs are based on.

IMDB mirrors do have the final list file that is the result of the final diff on 2017-12-22.
So we can patch in reverse to get the snapshots, but diffs are missing for 2017-01-31 and 2017-02-07.
This is true for both mirrors:
- ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/misc/movies/database/frozendata
- ftp://ftp.funet.fi/.m/mirrors/ftp.imdb.com/pub/frozendata

Not all lists can be patched back to 2014-02-14 as actors fails to reverse patch on 2014-10-10.

## synch.sh

Script that downloads the IMDB lists and diffs.

## patch.sh

Script to apply the diffs in reverse to get snapshots of each list for every timestamp.

## rdf.py

Script to convert IMDB lists into a single RDF file per timestamp.

To profile rdf.py, run:
```
./profilerdf.sh <rdf.py args>
```
